During his first years in CSIRO, he developed his research expertise in multivariate modeling, privacy preserving methods and Big Data. Since 2015, he refocused his application domain to risk analysis.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"598b63dd58b43bce02403646f240cd3c","permalink":"https://ick003.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"author","summary":"Adrien is a research statistician with interest in applied statistics and probabilistic risk assessments.
